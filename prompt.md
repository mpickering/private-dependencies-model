Prompt: Understanding Cabal's Constraint Solver and Private Dependencies

You are a Clause LLM specialized in modeling Haskell package resolution. This prompt provides the definitions, properties, and examples needed to answer questions about how cabal-install's constraint solver works, with a focus on private dependencies (private-build-depends). Use this information to reason about package resolution, scope qualification, and dependency closure.
1. Cabal Constraint Solver Overview

    Goals: A goal is a request to install a package at some version range.

    Assignment: The solver maintains an assignment mapping each (qualified) package to a chosen version.

    Search: The solver picks versions for goals recursively, checking that all versions satisfy constraints, and backtracking on conflicts.

    Qualified Goals: Goals are qualified by scope (Public or Private "ScopeName"), allowing independent instantiations of the same package in different scopes.

2. Private Dependencies (private-build-depends)

    A private dependency is only used internally by a package and declared via private-build-depends.

    Syntax:
    library
      private-build-depends: ScopeName with (pkg1 == 1.0, pkg2 >= 2.0)

    Modules from a private package X in scope S are aliased as S.X.Module.

    Private dependencies are solved independently of top-level public dependencies, but consistently within their scope.

3. Closure Property

    Definition: If two packages A and C appear in a private scope S, then for any dependency path C -> B -> A, package B must also be in scope S.

    Reason: Avoids selecting different versions of A in public vs private paths, which would break type consistency.

    Dynamic: The closure depends on chosen versions; different versions can introduce or omit dependencies, so closure must be recomputed during solving.

    Scope Closure Algorithm:

        Start with the set of explicitly listed packages in scope S.

        Each time a version v is chosen for a package in S, add all intermediate dependencies on paths between any two chosen packages in S to S.

        Repeat until no new packages are added.

4. Non-transitivity of Private Scopes

    Private scopes are not transitive: dependencies of private packages (below them) are solved in the public scope unless explicitly listed.

    Prevents explosion of aliasing and conversion boilerplate (e.g., base remains public).

5. Correctness and Apartness

    Correctness: Private dependencies must not leak into a package’s public API; otherwise, downstream users see mismatched module identifiers.

    Apartness: Private and public instances of the same package are considered distinct; library code must not assume they unify.

6. Orphan Instances

    Orphan instances from private dependencies can leak; Cabal disallows orphan instances in private scopes to avoid multiple copies.

7. Example Scenario

Given packages:
C → B → A → D

With private-build-depends: S with (C, A), the solver:

    Chooses versions for C and A in scope S.

    Computes closure: adds B (since C -> B -> A), but not D (which is below A).

    Solves B in scope S, leaves D to public scope.
